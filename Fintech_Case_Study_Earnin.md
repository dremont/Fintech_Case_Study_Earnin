Fintech_Case_Study_Earnin
# Overview and Origin
In this case study we will examine Earnin, a company originally founded in 2013 under the start up name “Activehours”. The company was started by Ram Palaniappan with the intention of providing another option to the traditional pay day loan, which Ram Palaniappan views as preying on unfortunate people who are already tight on money.

According to Palaniappan, the real culprit here is the very concept of the payday. The startup raised 4.1 million dollars to launch their app which allows people to gain access to money they have earned before payday.

In a normal work setting employees work a certain amount of time, usually over the course of 1-2 weeks and are paid at a later date, sometimes weekly, bi-weekly, or even monthly in some cases. For many people, having to wait until pay day can create financial strain especially for lower income families that need access to their money sooner. What Earnin allows their customers to do is get access to their money before their payday without the large interest rates usually associated with a payday loan. In fact, there is no interest. The only thing Earnin asks from its users is to give a voluntary “tip” of their choosing.

# Business Activities
The specific financial problem that Earnin is trying to solve withint the payday loan sector is providing quikc and easy access to micro payday loans with little to no interest. According to a survey conducted by LendingClub in May 2022, 64% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.

That is almost 2 out of every 3 Americans. Having access to a couple hundred dollars before payday for some could mean the lights don’t get turned off or having groceries for the week. But it is not limited to those in financial trouble, it can be used by anyone. Maybe you worked a job and are interested in making a purchase without having to wait two weeks, rather than taking a loan or using credit, you can access your hard owned money beforehand. To understand the significance of Earnin I think it is helpful to understand how traditional payday loans normally work. ccording to the Oxford Dictionary a payday loan can be defined as “a relatively small amount of money lent at a high rate of interest on the agreement that it will be repaid when the borrower receives their next paycheck”

According to Consumer Finance Protection Bureau there is no set definition of what a payday loan is but they do traditionally carry similar features. They are usually smaller loans which are required to be paid back on your next payday. If the loan is not paid back, in some cases the lender can pull the full amount directly from your bank account. Fees for payday loans can range from 10-30 dollars for every 100 borrowed. In other words, the fee can range between 10-20%. That means a payday loan of 1000 can potentially cost someone 300. As you can see for people living paycheck to paycheck this can create a cycle of needed to take out payday loans frequently to keep up with bills and fees.

According to bankrate.com twelve million Americans use pay day loans every year. The average is 375 with an average of 520 in fees. 80% of payday loans are taken out within two weeks of paying off a pervious payday loan with the majority of borrowers taking out multiple loans to make ends meet.

Some states have really high interest rates like Texas which is 36%. According to statista.com the average working American makes 10.86 an hour. That is a gross rate of 868.80 assuming a normal 80 hour work week. If you take 15% for taxes and benefits off the top that leaves 738.48. Taking a payday in that amount in Texas means that in two weeks that person will have to pay back 1004.33 which is more than they made before taxes and benefits. Without figuring out how to get an extra couple hundred bucks to cover your fees within two weeks the individual is left borrowing more money.

# Landscape
What Earnin is desgined to do is provide individuals the ability to make small payday loans with a fee that is based on the individuals financial ability to tip whatever they are able too. In fact, 95% of its revenue is from these tips, with 80% of its users tipping.

One of the most revolutionary things about it Earnin is that it is all done through an app. There is no need to travel to a payday loan store or wait for store hours, or speak to anyone in person. It is all done through an app and you can gain access to your money the same day. All you need is a checking account, the app, and a smartphone.

Another way Earnin is different is that it does not do credit checks. What Earnin does is access your bank account and work location to determine your regular pay period. Other options include sending an electronic timesheet or signing up with your work email.

Other apps similar to earning include Dave, Brigit, Chime. One of the interesting things about Dave is that is also does not do a credit check but instead reviews bank transactions to determine an individual's ability to pay back their loan. All of which doesn’t require someone to go into a store. Apps like Chime don’t offer payday loans but they do allow you to access your paycheck 2-3 days sooner. Brigit also allows cash advances from your paycheck by paying a low monthly subscription of $9.99. Bridgit will allow you to access up to 250 early each pay period. All of these apps offer some great features all of which seem to be better than the more traditional option.

# Results
The payday loan market is continuing to grow. According to Vantage Market Research the global payday loan market is estimated to reach USD 42.6 Billion by the year 2028. It is expected to grow 4.1% within this period. Although this communicates a serious problem, the opportunity for Earnin to continue to grow is certainly present.

The major trends within this domain is a move from traditional brick and mortar payday loan stores to it being completely online through an app. 

According to a press release by Earnin, they have provided 10 Billion dollars in loans to its users. They also stated they have over 2.5 million active users. In 2021 it was reported that about 80% of its user tip which comes out to about 8 million per month in earnings.

Earnin does seem to be a little behind other apps like Dave which is pubilicflly traded unlike Earnin which is still private. Dave is reported to have more than 10 million registered users. Dave also requires a small monthly subscription of $1 to use its resources. With 10 million active users that is 10 million in income. It is almost like a guaranteed tip. I think this small fee is one way Dave is performing better than Earnin. Payday loan companies make there money off of the interest of their users. These numbers are really competitive when you consider more traditional loan companies like Check City which is reported to bring in 65.1 Million per year. Dave could easily make 120 Million per year just in subscriptions all the while having less overhead or maintenance due to being completely online.

# Recommendations
If I could advise Earnin, I would tell them to require a low subscription price of $1 and offer more services such as a checking account or money management app. See would offer more support to its users who are trying to improve their financial situations. Educaitional videos on money management and how to build credit or job skills would also be a huge plus. I think this would create more users increasing the amount of subscriptions, interest, and word of mouth. They could take advantage of coding languages like python to create an easy to use money management app as well. This would give off the impression that the company isn’t simply trying to take money from its users but provide a service that will better their lives.
